# Merchant Integration Process - Step by Step

## Process Overview

This document provides a narrative description of the merchant integration process, outlining each step from initiation to completion.

## Process Actors

- **BDM (Business Development Manager)** - Initiates process and provides scope
- **TAM (Technical Account Manager)** - Main process owner, handles integration
- **Merchant** - Develops and implements integration  
- **KAM (Key Account Manager)** - Handles escalations for unresponsive merchants

## Process Flow

• **The BDM initiates the process** by scheduling a handover meeting with the TAM and providing the merchant's integration scope and requirements

• **The TAM receives the handover** from the BDM, reviewing all merchant details and scope documentation

• **The TAM schedules a kickoff meeting** with the merchant to begin the integration process

• **The TAM conducts the kickoff meeting** with the merchant to validate the scope and ensure alignment on requirements

• **If the scope is invalid or unclear**, the TAM requests a scope revision from the BDM and the process loops back to the handover stage

• **Once scope is validated**, the TAM begins supporting the merchant through their integration development process

• **During integration support**, the TAM monitors merchant responsiveness and engagement levels

• **If the merchant becomes unresponsive**, the TAM escalates to the KAM who then engages the merchant to facilitate continued progress

• **The merchant develops their integration** with ongoing TAM support and guidance

• **The merchant submits their completed integration** to the TAM for certification review

• **The TAM certifies the integration** against technical and business requirements

• **If certification fails**, the merchant makes necessary adjustments and resubmits until requirements are met

• **Once certification passes**, the merchant goes live with their integration

• **The TAM monitors the live integration** for 30 days to ensure stability and performance

• **After successful monitoring**, the TAM hands over the merchant to the Support team for ongoing maintenance

• **The process concludes** with the merchant fully integrated and transitioned to long-term support

## Key Decision Points

- **Scope Validation** - Ensures requirements are clear before proceeding
- **Merchant Responsiveness** - Triggers KAM escalation if needed
- **Integration Certification** - Quality gate before go-live
- **Monitoring Success** - Confirms stable operation before handover

## Process Benefits

- Clear handover between teams (BDM → TAM → Support)
- Built-in escalation path for unresponsive merchants
- Quality assurance through certification process
- Structured monitoring period ensures successful deployment
- Defined end-point with transition to ongoing support
